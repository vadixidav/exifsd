# exifsd

Exif serialization and deserialization

## Development

To run the tests for this library, the git submodule `exif-samples` must be checked out.

To do that run the following in this repository:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

You can also clone this repository recursively:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vadixidav/exifsd.git
```
